<p>How does daily overall sentiment affect the value of an industry?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We started this project asking a very simple question - or so we thought. We wanted to know how the attitude towards a company could impact its stock&rsquo;s value. It turns out that question brings a lot more weight than we could have anticipated:</p>

<ul>
<li>Finding companies in headlines is <em>hard</em> - it&rsquo;s a working problem in NLP!</li>
<li>Generalizing sentiment for a day helps us get around that, but it skews our evaluation of individual components (the headlines about a different company doesn&rsquo;t impact all others!)</li>
<li>Many models aren&rsquo;t perfect, but there are some that might hold some promise.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ideally from here we&rsquo;d like to work more on the Named Entity Extraction process so we can truly connect a headline with a specific business. If we can&rsquo;t isolate that a headline is related to a specific company or industry, then there&rsquo;s not much sentiment can tell us other than how the general market may be doing. Working on optimizing the neural network model after that would be ideal - our presented models show some early promises that could be better tuned. <a href="https://github.com/hyperopt/hyperopt">HyperOpt</a> is a great library to help automate the searching of models, but we might want to first revisit the type of Neural Network we used.</p>

<h2 id="the-bigger-picture">The bigger picture</h2>

<p>There&rsquo;s lots of ways to gain insight on Stocks: <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp">MACD</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/trading/support-and-resistance-basics/">Support and Resistance</a>, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rsi.asp">Relative Strength Index</a>&hellip; amoung many others. For example, here&rsquo;s a basic regression predicting the stock value direction based on closing prices <em>30 days prior</em>.</p>

<div align=center>
  <img src="/GaggleOfKaggle/img/close_regression.png" width=400>
  <div class="caption">A simple regression predicting closing prices based on a 30 day window (blue). Training data is in black while testing data is in yellow.</div>
</div>

<p>The bigger takeaway is that no single indicator trumps them all. Combining different ones to gain a more well-rounded prediction is a more strategic approach to automated trading, which is why adding Sentiment Analysis can help bolster a prediction. One of the advantages of Sentiment is that it can capture more knee-jerk reactions a stock may take throughout a day. Imagine breaking news hits a company is in dire straights, or holding high potential for days on end - while other means may see that, it won&rsquo;t be until after people have already started trading on that news. Combining Sentiment could help get your trade in sooner than the rest.</p>

<p>The work done in this project, then, is a stepping stone in this direction.</p>
