<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5709236/">Synopsis</a>. Key characters:</p>

<ul>
<li>Karin Parke: Police detective, DCI</li>
<li>Blue Colson: Shadowing Parke, used to work for &ldquo;tech crime&rdquo;</li>
<li>Shaun Li: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Crime_Agency">NCA</a> officer</li>
<li>Rasmus Sjolberg: Head of the ADI program at Granular (company).</li>
<li>Garrett Scholes: Behind #DeathTo, former employee working on ADI</li>
</ul>

<p>The plot is as follows.</p>

<h2 id="timeline-with-time-stamps">Timeline (With time stamps)</h2>

<h3 id="00-00-day-1"><strong>00:00 (Day 1)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Detective Karin Parke walks home, entering her apartment.</li>
<li>Turns on the news, where a controversial story about Disability Benefits is being covered. A News Columnist - Jo Powers - is taking backlash for unpopular views on the law/actions of a &ldquo;wheelchair Martyr.&rdquo; 20,000 people have signed a petition for her resignation.</li>
<li>Following Jo on her walk home:

<ul>
<li>The news continues to roll in the background speaking of another extinction that has occured: the Siberian Crane.</li>
<li>The news also reveals the Honey Bee Drones (known as ADIs) have been released for their second summer. The supposed solution to a Honey Bee extinction.</li>
<li>Pedestrians insult Jo on her walk home, for her writings. As she arrives at her apartment, she recieves a cake delivery.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inside, Jo finds the cake has been frosted with &ldquo;Fucking Bitch.&rdquo; Her and her husbands frustrations with the matter are evident.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="that-night">That night:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Jo is browsing the computer, looking at comments on her article. Most comments and twitter notifications are copious amounts of hate.

<ul>
<li>It is here the &ldquo;#DeathTo&rdquo; tweet is first seen, but not made a point of</li>
<li>It is also here the window is revealed to be slightly open - an entry point for a bee.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Karin is watching the news (still?), where performer &ldquo;Tusk&rdquo; is introduced in a segment.

<ul>
<li>After being a shown of a young fan mimicing his work, Tusk pokes fun at him (becoming excessively negative)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Karin is called to the scene of a crime - Jo Powers is dead.

<ul>
<li>Here she meets Blue Colson, Karin&rsquo;s Shadow/Sidekick and Nick Shelton (Part of detectives).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>After discussing who she is (and the horrible article she wrote), even Nick admits to signing the petition to get her sacked. Called it &ldquo;Clickbait&rdquo; article.</li>
<li>Team explores the murder scene, noting struggle and a wounded husband whose unconscience.

<ul>
<li>Twitter mentions are still rolling in on her computer</li>
<li>The CCTV codes are being accessed; All entry points appear secure, however.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As leaving the apartment, Blue notes not having a Driver&rsquo;s License and is &ldquo;waiting for driverless to go mainstream.&rdquo;</li>
<li>On the ride home, Blue talks about her previous work in Tech Crimes

<ul>
<li>Left cause of all the horrible things she&rsquo;s seen online (Karin noting she&rsquo;s old enough to remember when it was just in their heads).</li>
<li>Blue says &ldquo;these things (phones) absorb us, they know everything about us.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Blue left forensics due to seeing child torturing and murdering photos/videos.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-30-day-2"><strong>13:30 (Day 2)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>News on reporting on Jo&rsquo;s Death. The ticker has a headline &ldquo;ECHR rules &lsquo;cookies&rsquo; have human rights&rdquo;</li>
<li>Reviewing CCTV; no one came in or out. Rear one is broken though.</li>
<li>Blue searches aggressive tweats on Twitter using an advance(ish) search engine.

<ul>
<li>Karin: &ldquo;That internet stuff drifts off like weather, it&rsquo;s Half-Hate, they don&rsquo;t mean it. They hate in a marriage, that&rsquo;s 3D, &hellip;, that&rsquo;s sincere&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Husband wakes up; they go visit.

<ul>
<li>Describes her thrashing at her head, seizing. Smashing her own head &amp; cutting her own throat.</li>
<li>Couldn&rsquo;t get her to stop.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blue believes the cake may have been at fault; or something else. Thinks he&rsquo;s not the type.</li>
<li>Karin agrees to go after Blue&rsquo;s lead: an elementary teacher who sent the cake.

<ul>
<li>Blue looks up her social media along the way and points out she said &ldquo;#DeathTo JoPowers&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The teacher:

<ul>
<li>Did not pay for the expensive cake, she crowd sourced the money from a message board.</li>
<li>Said it was for her sister, to get the bakery to make it.</li>
<li>Justifies her actions for the horrible writings of Jo</li>
<li>Claims to be using her &ldquo;Freedom of Speech&rdquo; (Karin: &ldquo;To send a threatening message&hellip;)</li>
<li>&ldquo;It was funny&hellip;&rdquo;. Blue claims she wished Jo Dead, showing her the tweet. The Teacher responds saying that&rsquo;s not real, its a HashTag, a joke thing. Insert the name of someone whose being an asshole&hellip;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Give the teacher a &ldquo;Caution&rdquo; on the basis of the &ldquo;Offensive Communications Act&rdquo;.

<ul>
<li>Clearly not well enforced. Teacher asks if the others of the cake will be punished. Teacher says she didn&rsquo;t do anything. Karin tells her to start a thread about it.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="that-afternoon">That afternoon</h4>

<ul>
<li>Karin: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re arresting the husband, don&rsquo;t wallow in that. The internet will be pissed at someone else today.&rdquo;

<ul>
<li>Tusk is the new target on twitter. More hate and #DeathTo.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="that-night-1">That night</h4>

<ul>
<li>Tusk backstage of performance</li>
<li>Camera watching as he&rsquo;s about to smoke marijuana; was about to freak but it&rsquo;s legal.

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;Kinda takes the joy out of it&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Tusk attacked. Symptoms of Jo.</li>
<li>At hospital an ADI is pulled from his head while in the MRI, killing him.</li>
<li>Shaun Li of the National Crime Agency is introduced, inspecting Tusk&rsquo;s dead body and the ADI.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="27-00-day-3"><strong>27:00 (Day 3)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Karin and Blue visit autopsy to find an ADI that had bored into Jo.

<ul>
<li>Attacked the Brain&rsquo;s Pain center causing dire agony; enough to do anything to stop it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Visit the Company making ADIs, bankrolled by Gov&rsquo;t. Blue says people online are weary of it, thinking the bees are spying on them. Karin denies it &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a scizophraic world view&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Tour the facility, showcasing the Bee&rsquo;s in a large warehouse pollinating plants.

<ul>
<li>Introduced to Rasmus (CEO), explaining colony collapse disorder. They don&rsquo;t know the cause so the bees are designed to fill in the gaps.</li>
<li>Reveal ADI may have caused a Death.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rasmus examines the ADI from Jo - &ldquo;These are not designed to kill.&rdquo; When the malfunction they just break and hit the ground.

<ul>
<li>Blue &ldquo;what if someone hacks&rdquo;, Rasmus: &ldquo;Militray grade encryption&rdquo; &ldquo;Need a diagnostic tool.&rdquo;</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Rasmus shows them the bee traffic control center:

<ul>
<li>4,000 Bee&rsquo;s per hive, can see where any of the Hives and Bees are. Can search anywhere in the world. Have all the logs of where, when, and what.</li>
<li>Bees need to swap between hive jurisdictions; someone spoofed a hive perhaps.</li>
<li>Must be within 10-20 meters to do this.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Can&rsquo;t shutdown the ADIs without Gov&rsquo;t Approval and risk of ecological disaster.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="that-afternoon-35-00">That afternoon (35:00)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Karin says should go to NCA at this point, but doesn&rsquo;t want to give them the case. That is where Shaun Li appears - revealing the second death (Tusk).</li>
<li>Both victims of &ldquo;online shitstorms&rdquo; (Fire storms)</li>
<li>Karin: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not fingerprints, no DNA, it&rsquo;s like wishing them dead.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Blue finds out HashTag came from a bot to seed the HashTag.

<ul>
<li>Introduction to the &ldquo;Game of Consequences&rdquo;: Bot account links a video saying tweet #DeathTo and an image &amp; name of someone you don&rsquo;t like. If that person is picked enough, then that&rsquo;s the target to be eliminated at 5pm.</li>
<li>Determines the next victim by looking at top mentions for the Tag. Discover &ldquo;Clara Meades&rdquo; who had posted a disrepectiful image in front of a war memorial. Since Tusk isn&rsquo;t public yet, people don&rsquo;t realize the tweet is real; they are scaring her.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Blue pulls up Clara&rsquo;s Citizen Details (Li says she shouldn&rsquo;t have access). Gov&rsquo;t Employee Abuse?

<ul>
<li>Its a citizen database, with same information as was onthe phone but also a map with her current location. Like in a pretty tight area&hellip;</li>
<li>Karin calls Clara&rsquo;s roommate, somehow getting her number to warn Clara they are on the way.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Head to Clara, Blue has Rasmus track ADI&rsquo;s in the area. Rasmus has set a trap to try and ID the perp.</li>
<li>Rasmus detects a breach attempted, trying to trace it. The rest evacuate Clara to a safehouse, realizing the ADI is nearby. The ADI follows them on the car.</li>
<li>Trace fails, the thousands of ADIs have gone off the grid nearby, now under someone&rsquo;s control.

<ul>
<li>Phones become jammed, can&rsquo;t warn Blue and Karin fully.</li>
<li>Rasumus realizes the entire thing has been taken over, he has no control.</li>
<li>Swarm of thousands stream towards the house; they take shelter in Bath. Bees working together, eventually killing Clara.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bee&rsquo;s dispurse, body taken away.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="that-night-55-00">That night (55:00)</h4>

<ul>
<li>Debrief at HQ, Ramsus is there with Karin, Blue, and Li.

<ul>
<li>Bees aren&rsquo;t being steered, too many at once. They are controlling the system</li>
<li>Blue: Database determines the basic area isn&rsquo;t enough , which means the visual sensors are being used to distinguish who in the area.</li>
<li>Rasmus: The feed is secure from Hive to ADI, but the Gov&rsquo;t requirement for backing the project needed a backdoor to get into the feeds for &ldquo;times of increase national security&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Li knew of this. Classified. They are spying. They do CCTVs and Traffic.</li>
<li>Gov&rsquo;t would only fund it if they could get more</li>
<li>Prevented bombings and mass shootings by spying, but keeping safe. Except Clara.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ramsus is locked out. Blue determined to look inside an ADI.</li>
<li>Nick comes in with some leads on who would have had access to the ADI systems. Government employee list.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="60-00-day-4"><strong>60:00 (Day 4)</strong></h3>

<ul>
<li>Public learns #DeathTo link to murders.

<ul>
<li>News sensationalizing; tracking top 5 up for bat&hellip;</li>
<li>People blogging on YouTube, expressing either wrongnes of this or egging others to &ldquo;Make your #DeathTO choice count!!!&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s going to be top of list, why not make it someone who deservces it - like a &lsquo;racist&rsquo;&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;People can get away with it since no one knows who did it&rdquo;</li>
<li>How culpable are people?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="all-at-once-the-following-happens">All at once the following happens</h4>

<ul>
<li>Blue inspects the ADI&rsquo;s software contents

<ul>
<li>Finds a manifesto &ldquo;the teeth of consequences&rdquo; written by Garrett with a selfie attached</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Karen working on Employee interviews

<ul>
<li>Tess: worked in HR for Granular (ADI company) until she had interviewed someone who she had to threaten arrest over. Turns out the man had a learning disability that caught her huge flack on social media.</li>
<li>Tess: &ldquo;It was like having a whole weather system turn against me, hate after hate.&rdquo; A million invisible people talking about how they dispise you.</li>
<li>Admits she made a mistake, but people enjoyed &ldquo;kicking her&rdquo;; &ldquo;casual fun&rdquo;. Attempted suicide. Her flatmate &ldquo;Garrett&rdquo; found her bleeding out in the bathtub and kept her alive. Garrett worked at Granular on the ADI team.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Li meets with the Chancellor who is currently on the top of the list. People are discussing what to do.

<ul>
<li>Chancellor wants to shut down the whole internet, social media, etc - pull a North Korea on it.</li>
<li>Li advises against it, he&rsquo;d still be number one by 5pm.</li>
<li>Chancellor wants to leak something to skew the public away from himself.</li>
<li>Li wants to move chancellor to safe location, shows live video of army at the Hive. Plan to knock out nearby hives in the safe area.</li>
<li>After attempting to blow up the hive, the bees don&rsquo;t die and they kill the soldiers.</li>
<li>Can either knock out all hives and kill environment, or take victim a day.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="inspecting-the-manifesto">Inspecting the Manifesto</h4>

<ul>
<li>Garrett - &ldquo;Thanks to the technologal revolution we have the power to rage and accuse, but bile without consequence. Only if we recognize the power…&rdquo; … theme is he wants people to face the consequences of what they say and do.</li>
<li>Nick tweets #DeathTo with the picture of Garrett.</li>
<li>Inspecting the selfie taken, Blue realizes there&rsquo;s a geolocation tag leading them to where Garrett took the photo.</li>
<li>Garrett sees the tweet from Nick, and flees the scene. Rash, oversharing of information.

<ul>
<li>Inconsistency: Said Garrett left the country 6 months ago, yet they nearly missed him inside the country? Or was this just another ploy to mislead them?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>At Garrett&rsquo;s compound (hidden just outside Granular), Blue finds a burned harddrive in the forge that lets Ramsus regain control.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="at-rasmus-s-lab">At Rasmus&rsquo;s Lab</h4>

<ul>
<li>3 minutes left to 5pm. Rasmus has the source to take back control. Noticed a new file.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a list of IMEI numbers. 387,000 numbers. List of all people who used the HashTag. The backdoor allowed Garrett to get this info from the Government DB.

<ul>
<li>That&rsquo;s ~75% of the number of deaths in the UK for all of 2015; in 1 day.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Nick owns up to posting - he&rsquo;s on it.</li>
<li>Ramsus is ready to turn off the drones, Li wants to take action now given the Chancellor&rsquo;s life and Karin doesn&rsquo;t: &ldquo;He left them a trail&rdquo; Shutting it down could &ldquo;trigger an endgame, something with the list - the people on the list are his targets&rdquo; Consequences. The players are the targets.</li>
<li>Li presses the button against their urge.

<ul>
<li>They regain control of system</li>
<li>And then it goes right offline again. End game has been triggered.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="the-fallout">The Fallout</h4>

<ul>
<li>Garrett is changing his identity, dumps all his stuff in a lake - in a foreign country?</li>
<li>Warehouse of dead bodies</li>
<li>Karin in court hearing, recounting the events.</li>
<li>Describes Blue&rsquo;s death several months after, for possibly causing the whole sequence of events by springing his trap. Explains her stuff was found on a beach.</li>
<li>As Karin leaves court, she recieves message from Blue.</li>
<li>Blue faked death, ends with her trailing Garret from a Spanish Coffee shop after listening to the hearings.</li>
