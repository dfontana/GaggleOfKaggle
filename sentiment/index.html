<h2 id="sentiment-distribution">Sentiment Distribution</h2>

<p>To better understand the mood of our headlines, we needed to look at the distribution of Sentiment expressed by them; whether they were <code>Positive</code>, <code>Neutral</code>, or <code>Negative</code>. To do this we attempted both an analysis in the Python <a href="http://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/">Textblob</a> library, which is built atop <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a> and in the R <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentAnalysis.pdf">Sentiment Analysis</a> library.</p>

  <img src="/GaggleOfKaggle/img/python_sentiment_dist.png" width=200px>
  <div class="caption">R Sentiment (Left) vs. Python Sentiment (Right)</div>
</div>

<p>We found the two used slightly different approaches towards identifying sentiment, and as a result, the R library was able to tease out more information than the Textblob option, as shown above. As a result, we opted to work with the R based approach, since it gives us more diversity in the data to explore.</p>

<h2 id="sentiment-by-day">Sentiment By Day</h2>

<p>With daily stock prices in hand, we wanted to analyze the sentiment of each headline for a given day in order to potentially find a correlation between the two. We calculated the daily sentiment in three ways: Mode (the most common direction for headlines of a given day), Sum (the sum of all the sentiment scores for a given day), and Mean (the mean of the sentiment scores for a given day).</p>

<p>The distribution of sentiment for headlines based on the Mode had mostly Neutral days and very few positive days:

  <img src="/GaggleOfKaggle/img/SentimentModeDist.png" width=200px>
  <div class="caption">Sentiment Distribution - Mode</div>
</div></p>

<p>The distributions for sentiment based on the Sum and Mean were the same, and were overwhelmingly Negative:</p>

  <img src="/GaggleOfKaggle/img/SentimentMeanDist.png" width=200px>
  <div class="caption">Sentiment Distribution - Sum (Left) vs. Mean (Right)</div>
</div>

<p>Looking at the sentiments by day using Sum and Mean provided a different picture. The sentiments fluctuate, but there are clearly some days that have more positive or negative headlines than others:</p>

  <div class="caption">Sentiment by Day - Mean</div>
</div>

<h2 id="word-popularity">Word Popularity</h2>

<p>With an understanding of the sentiment, we now wanted to see what was the most popular words used in headlines. To determine this we used the <a href="https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud">WordCloud</a> library for Python to filter out stop words, then generate a wordmap with the most frequent terms relatively larger to lesser used ones. We then used the Python Imaging Library to stencil this cloud onto a map of Australia - in spirit of the project.</p>

<div align=center>
  <img src="/GaggleOfKaggle/img/wordmap.png">
  <div class="caption">Popular terms include the US, Winning, Plan, New, and Say.</div>
