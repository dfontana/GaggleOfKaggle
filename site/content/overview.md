This site documents the process and results of our Data Science 3001 term project at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. In this project we explore the Data Science process on a data set of our choosing, creating a final product of our choosing. For this project, specifically, we have opted to inspect the following questions:

> - How does daily overall sentiment affect the value of an industry?
- What phrases or words impact change within industry value the most?
- Is there any pattern or trends to these phrases?
- Can we predict a stock's next-day value based on prior sentiment?

To answer these, we'll be performing [Sentiment Analysis using R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SentimentAnalysis/SentimentAnalysis.pdf), Web Scraping with [ScraPy](https://scrapy.org/), data transformation in [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), Natural Language Processing in [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/), and exploring prediction methods such as Linear Regressions and SVMs. The process in which we explore this dataset and the final outcomes of this exploration can be found in the ensuing posts.
